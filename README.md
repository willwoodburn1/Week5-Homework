# Week5-Homework
Created the three files index.html script.js and style.css and added them to the folder Week5-Homework
Added the basic template from bootstrap and changed the text in the jumbotron
Created the twelve list items and added a button to each.
Using style.css I added the fonts, changed clors, and made the overall page more defined and appealing

Stored the saved items using JSON and local storage
Added a click function to the save buttons 
Had the saved items pushed to the empty array
